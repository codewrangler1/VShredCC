VShred Coding Challenge

Git repo for VShred Coding Challenge.

For this coding challenge, You will make a two activity application using either Java or Kotlin (this is done in Kotlin).

On the Main Activity should contain

Search View at the top

Recycler view

Name and “Favorite” Status (See Below)

As the user types in the search bar, display live search results to the user inside the recycler view.
You will be searching for people from Star Wars using the free star wars API at https://swapi.dev/. 
Use the Search functionality (ie “people/?search=”), but don’t worry about handling the pagination.  Just display the first page of the query.
When you tap on a person in the recycler view, open another activity

On the Detail Activity

Display this person's name, height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birth year, and gender where applicable
This page should also contain a "Favorite" button. 
Characters that are favorited should be saved to shared preferences. 
You should be able to see that a character is favorited on the recycler view cells (Main activity) and on the detail activity. 
You should be able to navigate back and forth between these 2 activities.
